__init__.py.
The double underscores in the filename tell us that this is a special file.
__init__.py represents the root of your package.
It should usually be kept quite simple, but itâ€™s a good place to put package constants,
documentation, and so on.

The special variable __version__ is a convention in Python for adding version numbers
to your package.

Variables defined in __init__.py become available as variables in the package namespace:
```
import icpp
icpp.__version__
```
